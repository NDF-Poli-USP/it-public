# Requesting Workstation Credentials Guide

Access to the workstations requires having workstation credentials. To request credentials, send an email to ndf-ti@usp.br with the following information:

- Personal information specified in the [User Info Form](https://github.com/NDF-Poli-USP/it-public/blob/main/computational-resources/user-info-form/README.md)
- A public key, which can be generated following the [Creating SSH Keys Guide](https://github.com/NDF-Poli-USP/it-public/blob/main/computational-resources/ssh-keys-guide/README.md)

### Network

Login to the workstations is done via SSH, from inside the NDF's private network.

Access to NDF's private network can be achieved by connecting in person at the lab or through the VPN. To request VPN credentials, send an email to ndf-ti@usp.br with the subject "**VPN Credential Request**".
